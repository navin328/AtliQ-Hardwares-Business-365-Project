# AtliQ-Hardwares-Business-365-Project
This project focuses on developing a comprehensive Power BI dashboard for AtliQ Hardwares, a global consumer electronics company. facing profitability challenges in the LATAM region despite strong global sales growth.  

The dashboard integrates data from Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive functions to deliver a 360° view of business performance. Using Power Query, DAX, and data modeling, key KPIs such as Net Sales, Gross Margin %, Forecast Accuracy, Regional Profit, and Customer Performance were analyzed to uncover actionable insights.

The analysis revealed that while Net Sales grew to $3.74B (+353.5%), Net Profit declined by –13.98% due to high marketing and operational costs. Additionally, forecast accuracy improved to 81.17%, highlighting progress in demand planning.

This project empowers AtliQ’s leadership to make data-driven decisions by improving cost control, optimizing inventory, and strengthening regional profitability strategies.
